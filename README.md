# password-generator

## Description

I was tasked to create an app that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by JavaScript code.

## Acceptance Criteria
Application must:

- Generate a password when the button is clicked.

- Present a series of prompts for password criteria:

- Length of password:

 -- At least 8 characters but no more than 128.

 -- Character types:

 -- Lowercase

 -- Uppercase

 -- Numeric

 -- Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

- Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

- Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
